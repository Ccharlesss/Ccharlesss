### Hi there, I'm Romain Charles Kuhne but you can call me Charles for simplicity

Having recently graduated with First-Class Honors in Software Engineering, I have developed strong skills in object-oriented programming, data structures and algorithms, computer science, software design, web development, and machine learning.

Through various projects using ASP.NET Core, ASP.NET MVC, FastAPI, Docker, and Jenkins, I have built a solid foundation in backend development and automated software testing. I am also an advocate of self-learning and am currently following a course to enhance my skills in CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins.

Beyond my technical expertise in computer science and software engineering, I am deeply interested in health, nutrition, and mental health awareness. My long-term goal is to one day launch a YouTube channel to discuss these topics and share knowledge with a broader audience.
